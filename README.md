# ADME Prediction with KNIME: Development and Validation of a Publicly Available Workflow for the Prediction of Human Oral Bioavailability (HOB)

# ABSTRACT

In-silico prediction of human oral bioavailability is a relevant tool for the selection of potential drug candidates and for the rejection of those molecules with less probability of success during the early stages of drug discovery and development. However, the high variability and com-plexity of oral bioavailability and the limited experimental data in public domain have mainly restricted the development of reliable in-silico models to predict this property from the chemi-cal structure. In this study we present a KNIME automated workflow to predict human oral bio-availability of new drug and drug-like molecules, based on five machine learning approaches combined into an ensemble model. The workflow is freely accessible and allows the quickly and easily prediction of oral bioavailability for new molecules, where users do not require any knowledge or advanced experience in machine learning or statistical modeling to automatically obtain their predictions, increasing the potential use of the present proposal.
